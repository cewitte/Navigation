# Navigation
Paul Hudson's 100 Days with SwiftUI - Project 9.

In this technique project we’re going to take a close look at navigation in SwiftUI – how we move from one screen to another using `NavigationStack`, both because the user asked for it and also because we want to do it automatically at a specific time.

Once we've covered those basics, we're going to look at more advanced navigation, including handling state restoration – remembering exactly where the user had navigated to, so when your app launches in the future they can pick up where they left off.

And when we're done with that we'll look at some customization options: changing the way the navigation bar looks, positioning your buttons just right, and even how to let your user change the navigation title on demand.

By the end of it all we'll have a much stronger understanding of how navigation works in SwiftUI, so we can really make the most of it in all your apps.
